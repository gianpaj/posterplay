PosterPlay
--

This is a Mobile App which searches YouTube videos by taking a picture. Cat pictures, concert posters, ads, celebs, movie posters, etc.

We hacked this in 24 hours at the TechCrunch 2013 NY Hackathon!

The app needs, at the moment, a backend server to store the picture and to hack the request to Google.

I'll add the code to this repository soon.
